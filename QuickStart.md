Are you panicking because there is no file menu? Press **Alt** to reveal it, then navigate with **arrow keys** and the **Escape** key (or your mouse, if you're that type of person).

Are you outraged because you can't see the taskbar and there is no "X" button to close the window? Press **Ctrl+Shift+X** to close the program.

Are you frustrated that you don't see icons for formatting your text? Press **Ctrl+H** for a quick popup listing most of the shortcuts. (This popup does not show the shortcuts for functions in the File Menu, as you can see those shortcuts in the file menu itself.)

This software is written with a keyboard-first mentality. You may find some things you intuitively think you can use your mouse to do--such as dragging and dropping the chapters in the Chapter List to the left--do not work. Give the keyboard a try! Once you learn the few shortcuts, it will become quicker and easier.

For instance, CTRL  + Up or Down will let you cycle through the chapters. But if you add the SHIFT key to that combo, it moves the displayed chapter within the list. Try CTRL+SHIFT+Down and see the Quick Start chapter move down in the Chapter List.

If you want to make a note in the Notes panel, press CTRL + Right to jump to it. Type a note, then press CTRL + Left to jump back into the main editor.

For navigating within a chapter, your HOME / END / PAGE UP / PAGE DOWN buttons operate the same as they do in most other applications. CTRL + HOME jumps to the beginning of the chapter. CTRL + END jumps to the end. HOME by itself jumps to the beginning of the line, END the end.

Within tool menus, you mostly navigate using the TAB button to jump between inputs/buttons--a red outline will show which one is selected. Then ENTER will click the selected button (or SPACE will check a checkbox). This is all normal website keyboard navigation.

The rest of this file is the novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, so feel free to practice navigating through its chapters, editing them, etc. Why does a writing program named after Virginia Woolf feature a novel by Mary Shelley instead? Good question, my friend. Good question.
