There is a spellcheck, but you have to run it after writing, which means you have to at least make an attempt to remember how to spell. This is good for you.\n\t\"Why can't I drag and drop to rearrange the chapters?\" Because this is written primarily for use with a keyboard. I wanted to disable the mouse entirely but can't make it work. So count yourself lucky, and try using it for a bit without your mouse. I promise you'll find it fast, pleasurable, and healthier for your hands.\n\t\"Why can't I change the font?\" Because you don't need to. This is designed to minimize distractions so you can get on with writing. Export it when you're done and play with fonts in another program all you like.\n\t\"Why aren't there page numbers?\" This is not a \"What You See Is What You Get\" style program. When writing fiction, I find word counts much more useful.
