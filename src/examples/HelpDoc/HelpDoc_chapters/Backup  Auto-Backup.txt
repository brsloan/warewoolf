[>c] # Backup / Auto-Backup

By default, every time you close WareWoolf, it will automatically backup the current project by creating a zipped file containing it in the designated Backups directory, which you can change in the "Settings" page. (So, for instance, if you're using WareWoolf on a writerDeck, you may designate the backup folder to be on a USB thumb drive in case your main filesystem becomes corrupted.) 

Each backup file is saved with the project filename as a base and then a 14-digit timestamp (4 year digits, 2 month, 2 day, 2 hour, 2 minutes, 2 seconds) so that when sorted alphabetically they are also sorted chronologically. You can set WareWoolf to keep only the latest X number of backups, or set this limit to 0 to keep all of them indefinitely. Every time it saves a backup, it will delete the oldest until down to the limit.

Should you ever need to revert to a backup, you can use the File Manger to navigate to your Backups folder, find the desired backup, and use the Unzip button to decompress it. Then you can open it and save it wherever you want to.

In addition to Auto-Backup, you can manually create a backup file at any time using the File \> Backup tool. It will follow the same rules of deletion as are set up for Auto-Backup.
