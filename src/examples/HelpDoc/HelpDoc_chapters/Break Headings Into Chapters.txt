[>c] # Break Headings Into Chapters

This tool does what it sounds like: it detects any text styled as a heading and splits the file at that line, creating a new chapter with that heading as the title.

It is useful, for instance, if you wanted to copy all of the novel Frankenstein from Project Gutenberg and paste it into WareWoolf for an example novel, and did not want to have to manually go through and divide the chapters into their own WareWoolf chapters.
