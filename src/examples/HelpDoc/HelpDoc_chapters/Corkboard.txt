[>c] # Corkboard

## How Do You Use it?

You create cards on a digital corkboard, each representing a chapter or scene. Each card has a title and description, and can be optionally given a color and checked off as completed. (For instance, you might check off each scene as you write them.) Then you can shift the cards around to re-order them. There are also "board divisions", dotted lines that divide the cards into equal groups. You can make as many divisions as you like, including one, meaning one continuous group. If you are writing a five-act play, you would use five divisions so that you can visually see each act as its own group of cards. Alternatively, you may think in terms of three acts (beginning, middle, end) and use three divisions to get a quick sense of the progression of your novel. Altering the number of divisions does not change your cards--only how they are presented--so you can try different ways of viewing and thinking about your work.

When you save your corkboard, it saves as a plain text document called "project_corkboard.txt" in the same directory as your chapters, which can double as an outline even without the corkboard. That also means you can write an outline in any text editor, and if you follow the simple markdown structure required, you can paste it into your corkboard file and it will automatically render as a visual corkboard in WareWoolf.

(FUN FACT: This is also available as an independent, online tool at https://brsloan.github.io/markdown-corkboard/).

## What is this special Markdown document structure?

You can use the Corkboard without worrying about the text document it generates at all, but if you want to know how it works or write/edit it directly, it is very simple.

Each card is represented by a heading, which is the title, followed by a paragraph, which is the description. In markdown terms, that means you will write one line with a \# symbol as the first character, followed by a space, and then your title, like this:

  \# Card Title

Then hit enter twice to create a blank line, and below the blank line write your description. Repeat for each card, leaving a blank line between each card, and that's it!

\# First Card Title

First card description.

\# Second Card Title

Second card description.

So far that is all standard Markdown, so you can open a corkboard document in any markdown editor and it will display correctly as a series of headings and paragraphs, but there are two additional features Corkboard uses which are not a part of normal Markdown. These are symbols to denote what color the card is and whether it is checked off, and they are very simple.

To assign a color to a card, after the \# symbol in the title, add square brackets with a single-digit number between 1-9 to assign a color to it, like this:

  \# [1] Card Title

To mark a card as checked off, add square brackets with an X between them, like this:

  \# [x] Card Title

If any card has both a color and is checked off, the color must come before the check, like this:

  \# [1] [x] Card Title

That's it!
