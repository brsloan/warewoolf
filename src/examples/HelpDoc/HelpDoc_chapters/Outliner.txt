[>c] # Outliner

This very simple tool gives you a list of every chapter, the word count for that chapter, and a field for a summary, all in a spread-sheet type layout. Its only real use (in my opinion) is for after you've written a draft and want to look over the overall pattern of chapters and chapter lengths. For actual pre-planning/outlining, I recommend using the newer Corkboard feature.
