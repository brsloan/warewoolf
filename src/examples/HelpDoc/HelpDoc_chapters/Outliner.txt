[>c] # Outliner

# This Feature Needs Work
Let's be honest here, the outliner WareWoolf currently has is the simplest possible version of a tool that could be called by that name. It gives you a list of every chapter, the word count for that chapter, and a field for a summary, all in a spread-sheet type layout. Its only real use is for after you've written a draft and want to look over the overall pattern of chapters and chapter lengths.

# Future Plans
I plan to write a new outliner to be available in addition to this that is more of a corkboard simulator, allowing you to create "index cards" in a grid with color-coded character labels, summaries, etc.
