[>c] # Properties

You can set project properties under File \> Properties. Here you can enter the Title and Author for the project, which are used for the metadata when you export .docx files, etc.

This screen will also show you the current project's filename and directory.

If you click the "Reveal Advanced" button, it will also show you the relative filepath for this project's chapters (the .txt files). By default, these are saved in a subdirectory called "[.woolf project's filename]_chapters". So if you saved your project as "Frankenstein.woolf", it will have created a directory called "Frankenstein_chapters". Therefore, the relative filepath is "Frankenstein_chapters/".

This is important because the .woolf project file is essentially a list of chapter filenames (Chapter 1.txt, Chapter 2.txt, etc.) along with the chapters directory filepath you see in this Properties tool. So when you switch to Chapter Two in WareWoolf, it looks up "Frankenstein_chapters/Chapter 2.txt". That means if you change this directory to something inaccurate, WareWoolf will try to load your chapters from the wrong location, temporarily breaking your file. That's why this function is hidden under "Reveal Advanced"--to prevent people from casually breaking their projects. But never fear--you can always just change it back to the correct location. (Note that the filepath always ends in a forward slash--"/". If you do not include one, it will add it.)

If your project file has the wrong chapters directory, it can also be fixed by a built-in "Chapter Finder" tool. Every time you open a project, WareWoolf checks to make sure the chapters are in the listed directory. If they are not, it pops up with a prompt telling you your chapters are lost. It gives you a file manager in which to select your first .pup file, and it then uses that to correct the saved chapters directory. After it has done this, you can save the fixed project file.
