[>c] # WareWoolf Basics

## Display Controls
On the left is the list of chapters, which you can re-order and rename. In the middle, the main editor. On the right, notes. These three panels can each be toggled on/off with **F1**, **F2**, and **F3**, so you can clear everything but the editor for a fully distraction-free experience, or make room for using a narrow vertical screen. 

To toggle between ***Chapter Notes*** and ***Project Notes*** in the** **right panel, press **CMD/CTRL + F3**. Chapter Notes are particular to each chapter and will update as you cycle through them, but there is only one Project Notes document, so it will stay the same as you cycle between chapters.

Speaking of room--the editor panel can be contracted or expanded using **CMD/CTRL** + **<** or **\>** so you can see your paragraphs as they will look in a narrow paperback or a wide manuscript page. Similarly, you can adjust the font display size with **CMD/CTRL** + **-** or **+**.

## Navigating Chapters
To cycle through chapters, press **CMD/CTRL** + **Up** or **Down**. **CMD/CTRL** + **Right** and **Left** will jump between the notes and main editor. These are the *Navigation Keys*.

To move a chapter up or down in the list, press **CMD/CTRL** + **SHIFT** + **Up** or **Down**. To rename a chapter, **CMD/CTRL** + **SHIFT** + **Left**. These are the *Alteration Keys*.

If you move a chapter to  the end of the list, and then move it down one more space, it will jump to the ***Reference**** *section. Any chapter in the reference section will not be included in project word counts or compiling.  This is for any material you wish to keep in the project, but which is not part of the novel itself.

## File Menu
Pressing **ALT **will reveal the file menu at the top of the screen **(CONTROL + F2 **on Mac, but see note on alternate below**)**. Here you can import, export, compile, or use many other tools, all easily accessible without a mouse by navigating the menus with the **Arrow Keys** and **Escape**. In addition to the usual find/replace, spellcheck, etc., there is a File Manager, a Wi-Fi Manager (if on Linux), an Outliner, and other tools.

**NOTE**: You can also open the file menu as a popup menu by pressing **CMD/CTRL + M**. This is mainly for Macbook users since the screen-dimming function on the F2 key would require a three-button combo (Fn + Ctrl + F2) which is annoying, but it also gives a slightly better menu type for keyboard navigation, so it is available on all operating systems.

## Tool Menus
When you choose a tool from the File Menu, it will pop up with a tool menu dialog with input fields, buttons, etc. You navigate through these with the TAB key until you highlight the field/button you want to use. SPACE checks checkmarks. ESCAPE exits any menu/dialog.

## Import/Export Tools
These all live under "File" in the File Menu. Please note that "Export" exports separate files for each chapter, while "Compile" saves one file with all chapters compiled together.

### Compile/Export options
Currently you can compile/export your work in plain text, .docx, MarkdownFic, Markdown, or HTML, with some helpful options regarding headings and chapter breaks.

## WareWoolf's File Format
WareWoolf saves its chapters as plain text files with light markup. There is a primary .woolf project file (which is just a JSON file that carries project metadata), and individual .txt files for each chapter in a subdirectory. 
	Frankenstein.woolf
	Frankenstein_Chapters
		Chapter 1.txt
		Chapter 2.txt
		Chapter 3.txt

The reason for doing this rather than one (more convenient) file is speed. This way, WareWoolf does not hold your entire (perhaps very long) novel in memory, but only one chapter at a time--the chapter you are viewing. 

Please note that the chapter files must be kept either in a subdirectory or the same directory as the project file. If you move them, WareWoolf will prompt you to show the new location at load.

## Help
And of course, if you ever need help remembering a shortcut, simply remember the shortcut **CTRL **+ **H (CMD + Shift + H on Mac)**, or use the file menu to open the Help menu, and all will be revealed.
