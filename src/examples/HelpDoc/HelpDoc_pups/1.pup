You are freed from writing fiction like it's a blog!\n\n\t- The supported syntax is all the same as Markdown:\n\t\t- Headings: '# My Heading 1', '## My Heading 2'\n\t\t- Italics: '*italicized text"},{"attributes":{"italic":true},"insert":"*"},{"insert":"'\n\t\t- Bold: '**bold text**'\n\t\t- Underline: '__underlined text__'\n\t\t- Strikethrough: '--struck through text--'\n\t\t- Blockquote: '> blockquoted text'\n\t\t- Footnotes (will be supported but not yet):\n  \t\t\t- 'Text with a footnote. [^1]'\n\t\t\t- '[^1]: The footnote.'\n\nThat's it! You don't need much formatting to write fiction.

This way, WareWoolf does not hold your entire (perhaps very long) novel in memory, but only one chapter at a time--the chapter you are viewing. \n\nPlease note that the pup files must be kept either in a subdirectory or the same directory as the project file.
