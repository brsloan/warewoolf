{"ops":[{"insert":"This tool is designed to remove one of the few sources of drudgery in writing novels. Say you have labeled each chapter by number, as is standard, but then decide to re-order the chapters in your revision, as is very common for me. Well, after rearranging thirty to one hundred chapters, now you have to go through and re-number every one for the new sequence. No longer, my friend! Let WareWoolf do this for you.\n\nWith this tool, you can give a \"Rename Format\", which can be any text with the string \"[num]\" where you want the number to go. So you could do the classic \"Chapter [num]\" and it will rename all of your chapters \"Chapter One,\" \"Chapter Two,\" etc. It can either do this just the Chapter Titles used in the list on the left in WareWoolf, or you can set it to replace the first line within every chapter itself if you've been writing chapter headings there.\n\nYou can also choose between spelled words (\"Three\") and numerals (\"3\").\n\nAnd you can designate it only to do it to a certain sequence of chapters. For instance, the example novel that comes with WareWoolf is Frankenstein, which starts with a series of Letters before switching to Chapters, so you could renumber only the first portion and use the Rename Format \"Letter [num]\", then renumber the second portion using \"Chapter [num]\". \n\nIf Mary Shelley had this feature, she would have saved so much energy she might still be alive today! And how she would hate it.\n"}]}
