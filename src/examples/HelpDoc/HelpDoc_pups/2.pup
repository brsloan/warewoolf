To do this, you have to create an App Password for your gmail account (on the Gmail website: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) and then use that password when you send emails through WareWoolf.\n\nWareWoolf does not save your password as plaintext, but it does save it with an extremely simple encryption algorithm. If someone gets access to your machine, it would be trivial for them to decrypt your password. This does not seem likely to happen, but just in case, I recommend you just create a free gmail account specifically to use for sending drafts to yourself. Then you put that into WareWoolf as the sender adress, and for the recepient address you can put your primary email. Then if an evil hacker in a hoodie hacks into your computer and decrypts the password, all they have is an account with a bunch of \"sent\" emails containing your poorly written smut. (And you can even set up gmail to automatically delete these so they won't even get that.)\n\nThis works perfectly for me.
