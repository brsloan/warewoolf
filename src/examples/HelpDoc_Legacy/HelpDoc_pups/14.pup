This is because it is designed for ease of use in a standalone writerDeck in which the user may not have access to any other software.\n\nHow"},{"attributes":{"header":1},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"WareWoolf currently only supports sending emails through Gmail. To do this, you have to create an App Password for your gmail account (on the Gmail website: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) and then use that password when you send emails through WareWoolf.\n\nWareWoolf does not save your password as plaintext, but it does save it with an extremely simple encryption algorithm. If someone gets access to your machine, it would be trivial for them to decrypt your password. This does not seem likely to happen, but just in case, I recommend you just create a free gmail account specifically to use for sending drafts to yourself. Then you put that into WareWoolf as the sender adress, and for the recepient address you can put your primary email. Then if an evil hacker in a hoodie hacks into your computer and decrypts the password, all they have is an account with a bunch of \"sent\" emails containing your poorly written smut. (And you can even set up gmail to automatically delete these so they won't even get that.)\n\nThis works perfectly for me. At the end of each day's writing session, I hit \"Send via Email\" and rest easy knowing it is now backed up in my email. But I make no promises about anything, as I am just a fool in Indiana and know nothing, so use at your own risk, etc. etc.\n\nFile Formats"},{"attributes":{"header":1},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"You can choose to email the current chapter or the entire project compiled in the format you wish. It defaults to whatever settings you last used in the \"Compile\" tool. If you select to email the Project File, this works differently--it creates a compressed .zip file of your .woolf project file and .pup chapter files all together so you can easily back up everything with your notes, etc., intact.\n\nAll of the above also applies to the \"Send Error Log Via Email\" function.\n"}]}
