This is so that if you use something like the Alphasmart Neo or Astrohaus Freewrite, or write in Vim or whatever, and save those files as plain text, you can then import all of them into WareWoolf for styling, organizing, and editing.\n\nOf course, you can just start writing directly in WareWoolf, but if you "},{"attributes":{"italic":true},"insert":"do"},{"insert":" use plain text for your first drafts, there are two ways to approach it so your files will work well with WareWoolf...\n\n1. Just Write"},{"attributes":{"header":2},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"Write whatever you want however you want and then edit/format it in WareWoolf. You will not lose manual tabs or white space on import, but you will have a few options for automatic styling of chapter headings and italics:\n\n- Convert text you've marked as italics.

[^1]'\n\t\t\t- '[^1]: The footnote.'\n\nThat's it! You don't need much formatting to write fiction. And since it is all the same as Markdown, anything exported as MarkdownFic should be usable in any Markdown editor, with the proviso that you may need to find/replace your tabs to newlines.\n\n"}]}
