This is why it is optimized for use without a mouse and has built-in email functions.\n\nWhat is a writerDeck?"},{"attributes":{"header":1},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"A writerDeck is a device dedicated specifically and solely to writing. Technically, a typewriter is an analog writerDeck. But usually we mean some sort of computerized word processor, such as the Astrohaus Freewrite or the Alphasmart Neo, to name two of the most popular mass-produced versions. But these tend to be either too expensive or too limited for many writers, so many of us build our own.\n\nThe term \"writerDeck\" comes from \"cyberDeck\". People argue over what counts as a cyberDeck, but in practice it basically means \"a weird cobbled together computer, usually without a mouse and usually homemade, often with a retro-futuristic, cyberpunk vibe.\" So a writerDeck is just a cyberDeck dedicated to writing.\n\nFor more on writerDecks, see www.reddit.com/r/writerDeck.\n\nWhy would anyone want one? Why not just use a computer?"},{"attributes":{"header":1},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"One major reason is distraction. If your writing machine is also your video watching machine, you may find it difficult to get much writing done. When you use a writerDeck, you can only do one thing: write.\n\nA second reason is pleasure. If a significant focus of your life is on writing, and much of your day is spent writing, then having a beautiful, dedicated device for doing it is very nice!\n\nA third reason is because they are fun to design and build.\n\nHow do I use WareWoolf on a Raspberry Pi for a writerDeck?"},{"attributes":{"header":1},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"A full explanation is too much for this help doc, but here is a general outline on how to set up a Raspberry Pi to boot directly and only into WareWoolf, with no desktop or other apps to distract:\n\nThe Basic Approach"},{"attributes":{"header":1},"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"OS With No Desktop"},{"insert":" + "},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Display Server"},{"insert":" + "},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Window Manager"},{"insert":" + "},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Your App"},{"insert":" = a single-app device.\nIn this case, that means:\nRaspberry Pi OS Lite + Xorg + Matchbox + WareWoolf"},{"attributes":{"align":"center"},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"\nThe Steps"},{"attributes":{"header":1},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"\n1.
