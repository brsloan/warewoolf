(\"Chapter Titles\" here means the label you gave your chapters in the list on the left in WareWoolf, not any titles you may have written within each chapter itself. So if, like me, you are in the habit of writing \"Chapter One\" at the beginning of each chapter, there would be no need to use this function.)\n\nIf compiling to .docx, you can also automatically generate a title page with word count, etc. This will pull your address info, if any, from the \"Settings\" page.\n"}]}
