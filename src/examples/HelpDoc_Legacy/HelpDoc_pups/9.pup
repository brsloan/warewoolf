It is intentionally simplified: you cannot change the font, line spacing, or color. But it has everything you need to organize, edit, and revise a novel--and you don't even need a mouse.\n\nIt is composed of three simple text-based panels with no icons: Chapters, Editor, and Notes.\n\nThat's it. There is no toolbar with twenty buttons cluttering the screen. There isn't even a file menu unless you summon it. All formatting is done with shortcuts. (But don't worry, there aren't many to memorize, and you can always press "},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"CTRL"},{"insert":" + H to show them all in the Shortcut Helper.

This keeps very long novels from slowing the application at all, even with low-memory computers such as a Raspberry Pi.\n Outliner (very simple as is, but plan to improve drastically)\n Adjust width of text editor and how large text is displayed.\n Spellcheck, but it must be run after writing (no form of auto-correct or red squiggles or godawful grammar advice).\n\nDisplay Controls"},{"attributes":{"header":2},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"\nOn the left is the list of chapters, which you can re-order and rename.
